## Investigating the correlation between the violence of the prisoner and the number of reoffences committed.

## Our Data Set and Research Question
---
# The Prison Data Set

- Our original data set came from the Government website, and details the criminal offences committed in prisons in England and Wales between the months of January and March of 2023.

- We tidied the data, mutating the detailed offence to show whether the crime committed was violent or non-violent. When doing this, we took violent to mean "the use of physical force as to injure, abuse, damage or destroy". 

- The variables in the data set were mainly characters so we changes many of these variables to be numerical to make producing models and visualisations easier. 
---
# Our research question and its importance?

- We wanted to investigate whether any variables of the prisoner like sex, the prison type they are at, violence of the prisoner and age had any correlation with reoffending.

- Our dataset has 24,647 prisoners who committed a crime in prison during the first quarter of 2023. Of these prisoners, 8137 reoffended multiple times. If a trend, and therefore a solution could be found, the number of reoffenders could decrease creating a safer environments in prisons.

# Summary of Findings

- The models show us that the chance of reoffence cannot be predicted by any variable, including the violence of the crimes committed.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
